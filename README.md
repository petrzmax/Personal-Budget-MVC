# Personal Budget
---
Personal Budget is educational web app created with PHP, HTML, JS & CSS. The main goal of this project was to get familiar with **MVC** design pattern and PHP language.
At this point I wasn't familiar with JavaScript, so scripts are not the best, even after some refactor.

It was created on a custom-made PHP framework, uses Twig as the template engine, and Bootstrap framework. Validating email address, editing categories and displaying balance sheet are implemented with **AJAX** queries.

With this app, You can track your income and expenses. Later on, You will be able to check Your balance from a desired period of time. You can also set expense limit for chosen categories.
